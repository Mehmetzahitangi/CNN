# CNN Examples From Scratch

Subject: Creating A Convolutional Neural Network Architecture



The CNN code contains one convolution layer, one maxpooling layer, a flattening layer and one fully connected layer. The transfer function of the output layer is softmax function.
There are five different filters.




The fundamentals of CNN architecture are in project report PDF. Other details added to code document as comment lines.
